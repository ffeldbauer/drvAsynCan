## configure/RELEASE: Location of external products

# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application top
# directory whenever this file is changed or any external module
# pointed to by this RELEASE file is rebuilt.

# If you don't want to install files into $(TOP) then define
# INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here:
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

# Define path to sequencer if needed
#SNCSEQ=/usr/Epics/modules/seq

# Asyn
ASYN = /usr/Epics/modules/asyn4-21

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can preempt definitions
EPICS_BASE=/usr/Epics/base-3.14.12.3
